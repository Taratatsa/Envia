## Mécaniques
### Prices of items are in a state of flux
Prices in the real world aren’t static and neither do they need to be in your game. The forces of supply and demand are in full effect even in a fantasy realm and a group or individual throwing around a lot of coin in a single village could rather quickly cause the price of things to increase for at least a little while. The easy way by which I simulate these changes in price is by the roll of a d20. A roll between 7 and 13 means prices are average and I don’t make any changes to the listed prices of items in the Player’s Handbook. A roll of 6 or less sees me reduce the price by 1% to 5% for each number below 7 (thus a 6 is a 1-5% reduction in price, while a 1 could be as much as 5-30%). A roll of 14 to 20 will see a price increase along the same lines as the price decrease (14 being 1–5% more expensive and 20 being 5–30% more).

### Magic items aren’t as hard to price as you might think
The Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything all mention rules for buying and selling magic items, but none of those three sources ever offer any kind of pricing guidance. A lot of people like to play D&D in the classic fantasy style where storefronts in towns and cities might offer magical doodads, weapons, and more to the discerning (and wealthy) customer or traveling merchants may deal in the odd item of power, and 5e’s rules didn’t really offer guidance on that style of play. My solution is very simple, roll a d10 and multiply it by a multiple of 10. Common items are worth 1d10x10 gold pieces, uncommon multiplies by 100, rare by 1,000, and very rare by 10,000. Unique, legendary, and artifact items I consider to be priceless and it takes more than coins and gems to obtain one. If you like, roll a d% and get a more dynamic price in gold pieces; multiply uncommon by 10, rare by 100, and very rare by 1,000.

### Gems are better as currency and trade for their value but sell for less than their value
Those moonstones you found after defeating the hobgoblin warriors are appraised at 10 gold each! Almost enough to pay your living expenses for a whole week!
Sorry, but unless you are taking them straight to a jeweler or a wizard you aren’t going to be too thrilled with the price that you actually get for them! Gemstones may physically represent wealth, but they are also essentially useless as anything other than a representation of wealth to most people. Aside from the handful of spellcasters out in the world who use them for magical purposes and people who specifically work with jewels, the idea of the gem is worth more than the gems themselves. Those gems offered in equal trade suddenly become more valuable, essentially unto the value of the same amount of coins themselves. Gemstones are treated more like a currency than anything else by the average person.

### At any given time an NPC has enough gold pieces to finance 10 days of their lifestyle  
An easy way to decide how much money a typical NPC has at any given time just figure out their lifestyle costs and multiply it by enough money to live like that for 10 days. It may not be ‘realistic’ but it gives you as a DM an easy frame of reference to just how much gold somebody has in case player characters try to steal from them or something. A typical NPC living the typical modest lifestyle has coins worth about 10 gold, a wretch who lives out on the street will probably have no money at all, someone living in the squalid conditions brought on by serfdom might be lucky to have enough pennies and farthings to equal a single gold piece, and so on up until you reach the aristocratic noble who is probably carrying at least 100 gp worth of coins and gems with him.

### The Divide isn’t always between rich and poor, it’s also between rural and urban  
Those people living in villages and other smaller settlements have the same needs as the people living in larger settlements but possess fewer means to get them. Money is a scarce commodity for the average subsistence farmer and items that PCs might think nothing about purchasing even in the early game could be completely out of reach for most NPCs simply because they aren’t made available. Inside the walls of towns and cities, there may be even more people living in squalor and poverty than there are for leagues outside of them, but those poor souls possess more coins than most of their rural counterparts do because money, but not necessarily wealth, is concentrated in population centers.

In rural areas, wealth is best represented by resources.

> Greg the Garlic farmer outside the Village of Honeywood may possess a nice house and have plenty of food to eat, but if he has more than a few silver shillings in his pouch he possesses an unusual amount of money. He gets his clothes, food, and lantern oil by trading his farm produce in exchange for them, and what coins he does earn he either earns by selling surplus to a traveling peddler passing through Honeywood or he took to a market in the nearby town to sell.

In urban areas, wealth is best represented by coins.

> Underian is a young elf that lives in Riften where he works at a meadery during the day and does a fair amount of carousing at night. He always has clean clothes and a full belly and while he might worry about employment, he isn’t concerned about ending up on the street because he has enough money saved up to pay for his needs and the room at his bunkhouse for a tenday at least if he stops drinking and gambling for a bit. He doesn’t own much more than his few sets of clothes and a dagger, but he has saved up about 10 gold worth of coins and has his eye on maybe someday renting his own apartment, or even a small townhouse if he can marry well.

Both of the characters in these above blurbs live a modest lifestyle equivalent to costing 1gp per day. Greg’s 1gp is represented by material goods he got on his own through labor and Underian’s 1gp is paid to him in wages by an employer in a city, but both of these characters live more or less the same when it comes to comfort. The biggest difference is Greg is unlikely to be able to offer money in exchange for the things he needs, he can offer you garlic, or some help fixing the daub on your chicken coop, he could drive a wagon for you, cook a hearty garlic heavy meal for you and let you sleep by his hearth. Underian can offer you a modest part of his savings in cold hard coins for the things he needs.

The same difference applies to the upper classes too; Kurtis the country lord might have an imposing castle and a retinue of loyal soldiers and servants to protect and run his estate, but he collects his taxes in the form of garlic, oats, and repairs on his castle walls. Lucretia who is the baroness of Praven collects her taxes in the form of coins and lives in a mansion located near the town’s center. Both of them are wealthy or aristocratic people, but Kurtis has some gold for when the need is dire and his servants and soldiers are mostly compensated with comfortable accommodations, fine clothing, and good food and drink; Lucretia’s servants are paid in coins, her soldiers are mercenaries, she must hire artisans to maintain her palace and town’s defenses. The Baroness would offer to reward PCs with money; Lord Kurtis would need to seek funds from the kingdom or offer something like a steading with 30 acres of prime woodland to award PCs with.

I hope some of these mechanics and ideas can help or inspire my fellow DMs and worldbuilders who are looking to try and come up with ways to make the setting feel a little less weak. If this gets good reception and/or activity I will try to share further shortcuts and ideas I use for things and maybe even suggestions on how to handle more advanced economy ideas like trading in rare, very rare, and legendary items.
