It depends on what you define as a campaign and what your group is looking for. This should be discussed, but I do have my preferences.

If itâ€™s published modules, I usually do them back to back with coherent-ish levels.

As for homebrew worlds/campaigns, I personally tend to play open-world campaigns. We start at a certain level, often:
- 1 for beginners ;
- 0 (1 with narratively-coherent disadvantages, for instance no/low-efficiency weapons for martial classes and only cantrips for casters) or 3 for more advanced players.

Then we play. I see which plot-hooks the players bite at and push the narrative in this direction. We level up rather consistently.

I do split my campaigns in 3 or 4 arcs. I recommend watching "How to Plan A D&D Campaign: The 3 Arc Structure - DM Academy" by Enter the Dungeon to get a grasp of it. TL;DR:
- Separate the campaign into (big) campaign arcs, likely following the tiers of play. What is the bigger picture?
- Split the campaign arcs into (medium) narrative arcs. How do you go from Arc 1 to Arc 2?
- Build Narrative arcs on immediate arcs. What is the party currently doing?

I usually level up every narrative arc.
