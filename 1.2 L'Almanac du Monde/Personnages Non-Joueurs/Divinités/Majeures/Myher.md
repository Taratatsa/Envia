# Myher
Myher is a deeply glorified and vastly embraced god. Luck, growth and hospitality are the main three elements this divine being is associated with and his personality is often described as pretentious and treacherous.  
Often depicted as incredibly tall, muscular, pretty and elegant Myher is usually worshipped through gifts and alms.  
  
There's all sorts of places for those yearn for the blessings of Myher, but pagodas and handheld symbols are typically found to be a good place to start.  
Worshippers are quite numerous and tend to come in the form of tavernfolk and commoners, but welcome are all among the followers of this god. Even if the right gifts and alms cannot be abided by.  
  
Myher has no luck with lovers. This changes little in regards to the aid Myher could potentially provide, but without allies to back them up even gods can fall.
