# Hytix
Hytix is a highly praised and deeply esteemed goddess. Food, night and nature are very important elements this divine being is associated with and most would regard her as imaginative and monstrous.  
Often depicted as a human with the body of a reptile Hytix is usually worshipped through offerings and pledges.  
  
There's a few main places for those who desire the wisdom and guidance of Hytix, but natural sanctuaries and altars are pretty much the single most common form of worship.  
Worshippers are plentiful and tend to come in the form of professionals and explorers and others are generally ignored by this goddess. Sometimes even when the right offerings and pledges are not met.  
  
Hytix has no lovers. Which only fuels the power Hytix will provide, but only the strongest of gods can stand alone.
