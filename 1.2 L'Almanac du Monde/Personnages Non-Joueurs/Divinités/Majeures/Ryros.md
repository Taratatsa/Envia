# Ryros
Ryros is a vastly obeyed and often trusted god. Thunder, fortune and envy are very important elements this divine being is associated with and his personality is often described as difficult and cheerful.  
Often depicted as tall, slender, young and bright Ryros is usually worshipped through oaths and gifts.  
  
There's many different places for those yearn for the blessings of Ryros, but homemade shrines and pagodas are pretty much the single most common form of worship.  
Worshippers are quite numerous and tend to come in the form of guards and nobility, but all others are welcome to seek the aid of this god. Even if the right oaths and gifts cannot be abided by.  
  
Ryros has countless lovers, but the main one is Mota. Granted this changes nothing to the power Ryros will provide, but even gods stand vulnerable when on their own.
