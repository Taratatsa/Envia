# Into the Arena

**ANTINUOUS, THE SUITORS**
Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too
You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through
I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could
This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good
So

Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain mе?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Lеt's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

Or die, little wolf, die
Don't you know it's fight or
Fly, little wolf, fly
All because you had to
Try, little wolf try
Run away before you
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die
